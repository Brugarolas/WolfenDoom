This is here as a reminder of the issues / to-do we notice from time to time.
Remove the problem / to-do from this list once it is done - OZY81

- Test all brightmaps, some actors seems to use too many spawned lights which can be removed (specially during attacks)
- Verify actors behavior, mainly props and enemies
- Verify every situation on maps where models disappear and use RenderRadius (but watch out about performance!) or bridges if needed
